                    Miss Lekota's Clothing Store was founded in 2022by fashion enthusiast and entrepreneur, kgabo Lekota. Growing up with a passion for style and a keen eye for trends, 
                    kgabo dreamed of creating a space where individuals could express themselves through fashion without breaking the bank.
                    Kgabo's journey began in her hometown, where she started by selling handmade clothing and accessories at local markets and pop-up shops. 
                    Her unique designs and commitment to quality quickly garnered attention, and soon, demand for her creations began to soar.
